        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Hi! I am Arne Schumann, a Senior Scientist at <a href="https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/en.html" target="_blank">Fraunhofer IOSB</a> in the department for <a href="https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/en/competences/image-exploitation/videoauswertesysteme.html" target="_blank">Video Exploitation Systems</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
            My work focuses on developing and integrating computer vision and deep learning models.
            My position allows me to lead and work on projects that include a wide range of vision applications.
            Primarily, I work on object detection using deep learning models in electro-optical and infrared data for, e.g., ship detection in maritime settings, drone detection, vehicle detection in aerial imagery or ground-based camera networks, and person detection.
            The second major part of my work is re-identification of persons and vehicles, including recognition of auxiliary information, such as pose and attributes (e.g., wears-hat, carries backpack, etc.).
            I also have done work on semantic segmentation and scene classification for aerial imagery, fine-grained recognition of vehicles and products, and quality assessment in production processes.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Previously, I completed my PhD at the <a href="http://cvhci.anthropomatik.kit.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Vision for Human Computer Interaction</a> (CVHCI) lab, <a href="http://www.kit.edu/english/index.php" target="_blank">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology</a> with Prof. Rainer Stiefelhagen.
            My thesis focused on person re-identification through conventional computer vision and deep learning models.
            Specifically, I included human pose information into the re-identification process to better handle pose variation, camera angle, occlusions and similar influences.
            I also stayed at the <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science</a> (EECS) at <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/">Queen Mary University of London</a> with Prof. <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~sgg/">Shaogang Gong</a>. There, I worked on learning domain prototypes for domain-adaptive person re-identification requiring only a single image.

        <div id="abstract_p45" class="collapse" style="text-align:justify;color:#606060;">The increased availability and capabilities of drones in the consumer market has lead to increased risk in air
traffic control and other public safety concerns. Automated drone detection systems can help to generate alerts
and increase reaction time by security forces. Recently proposed approaches and systems are usually based
on a combination of sensors and machine learning to carry out the detection of drones. While electro-optical
imagery is the most prevalent modality, infrared sensors can complement it by providing better visibility in
certain situations with cluttered background or low light conditions. A key limitation when using infrared data
is the limited availability of data for training machine learning methods.
In this work, we specifically focus on the task of drone detection in infrared imagery. Our main focus lies
on investigating how the small amount of available infrared data can be compensated for. We approach this
problem through three different types of experiments. First, we compare a detector resulting from training on
limited infrared data with a detector trained on more diverse optical data. We then propose and evaluate several
methods for pre-processing optical data in such a way that it better resembles the characteristics of infrared
data. Finally, we train detectors on a combination of infrared and pre-processed optical data and evaluate the
trade-off between amount of available infrared data and achieved accuracy of the resulting detector. We evaluate
all detectors on our own set of diverse infrared recordings. Our results show that suitable pre-processing of
optical data can significantly improve the resulting accuracy and performs much better than training solely on
limited infrared data.</div>
